				<h1>Smart Home Simulator</h1>
			</div>
			<p>The main goal of this simulator is to minimise costs and time
				when deploying a smart environment into the real world.</p>
			<p>Smart environments are becoming increasingly desired
				especially in the application of creating smart homes to aid the
				automated care of elderly or disabled people. The older population
				is the most common to suffer from chronic diseases and general
				disability and with the elderly population predicted to increase
				dramatically in the near future and with life expectancy also
				increasing it seems logical that medical sensor technology and
				nursing assisting software are eager to be developed and
				implemented. The implementation of this technology into a home or
				similar environment is still in its very stages. The main motivation
				for this type of application is that smart environments are very
				difficult and expensive in term of both money and time, to setup,
				implement, test, maintain and make usable, configurable. These
				difficulties can be over-come by making a virtual environment for
				engineers and researchers interested in smart environments to create
				virtual trial runs and gather extra data that will hopefully help
				make real physical implementations of smart environments less error
				prone and therefore less expensive.</p>
