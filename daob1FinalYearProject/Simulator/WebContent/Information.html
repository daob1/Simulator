<h1>Smart Home Simulator</h1> 
<p>
The main goal of this simulator is to minimise costs and time when deploying a smart environment into the real world.
</p>
<p>
Smart environments are becoming increasingly desired especially in the application of creating smart homes to aid the automated 
care of elderly or disabled people. The older population is the most common to suffer from chronic diseases and general disability 
and with the elderly population predicted to increase dramatically in the near future and with life expectancy also increasing it 
seems logical that medical sensor technology and nursing assisting software are eager to be developed and implemented.  The 
implementation of this technology into a home or similar environment is still in its very stages. 
The main motivation for this type of application is that smart environments are very difficult and expensive in term of 
both money and time, to setup, implement, test, maintain and make usable, configurable. These difficulties can be 
over-come by making a virtual environment for engineers and researchers interested in smart environments to create 
virtual trial runs and gather extra data that will hopefully help make real physical implementations of smart 
environments less error prone and therefore less expensive.
